# 🎮 Playground: A Space for Experimentation  

Welcome to my **playground** repository! This is where I explore and experiment with different technologies, ranging from **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** to **GitOps** and beyond. Think of this as a digital lab—messy, creative, and always evolving.  

## 🛠 What You’ll Find Here  
This repository contains **rough ideas, prototypes, and experiments**, similar to fleeting notes in the Zettelkasten method. The goal is to **learn by doing** without worrying about perfection.  

### 🔍 Topics I Experiment With:  
- **Cloud & Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
  - Terraform, Ansible, Pulumi  
- **Kubernetes & Containers**  
  - Helm, Operators, K3s experiments  
- **Security & Cybersecurity**  
  - Threat modeling, security automation, CTF challenges  
- **DevOps & GitOps**  
  - CI/CD pipelines, automation scripts, observability tools  

## 🚨 Disclaimer  
This is **not** a polished repository. Some configurations may be incomplete or broken—this is all part of the learning process!  

## 🚀 Why This Exists  
This playground serves as a personal **sandbox** to test new ideas before implementing them in real projects. If anything here interests you, feel free to reach out or fork it for your own experiments!
